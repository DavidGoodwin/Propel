# PropelÂ 

 * Propel 1.x is no longer maintained by the upstream project. 
 * You probably shouldn't start a new project using Propel 1.x.
 * This repo has a handful of patches applied to get unit tests to pass (e.g. with PHP 7.2), and sufficient phpdoc fixes to allow psalm (http://github.com/vimeo/psalm) to work on generated code.

## A quick tour of the features ##

Propel has some nice features you should know about:

 - It's a fast and easy way to manage your database;
 - It provides command line tools for generating code (well documented with an IDE-friendly syntax);
 - It's very flexible: you can simply extend Propel;
 - It uses PDO (PHP Data Objects) so it allows you to use the RDBMS of your choice (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Oracle and MSSQL are supported);
 - Propel is an open-source project which is [well documented](http://propelorm.org/Propel/documentation/).
